# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Documentation Maintenance Agent is an AI-powered system that automatically keeps documentation synchronized with code changes. The agent monitors code repositories for API changes, function signature modifications, and structural updates, then intelligently updates relevant documentation to reflect these changes. This hybrid agent combines deterministic code analysis (parsing, diff detection) with AI-powered natural language generation to maintain accurate, contextual documentation without manual intervention.

The agent addresses the common problem of documentation drift where code evolves but documentation becomes stale, leading to confusion, bugs, and wasted developer time. By automating this maintenance, teams can ensure their documentation remains a reliable source of truth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Change Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to automatically detect when I make changes to code that affects documentation, so that I don't have to manually track which docs need updating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code file is modified THEN the agent SHALL parse the file to extract API signatures, function definitions, and exported interfaces
2. WHEN comparing current code to previous versions THEN the agent SHALL identify specific changes including added functions, removed functions, modified signatures, and changed return types
3. WHEN a change is detected THEN the agent SHALL determine the scope of impact (public API vs internal implementation)
4. IF a change affects only internal implementation AND does not modify public interfaces THEN the agent SHALL NOT trigger documentation updates
5. WHEN multiple files are changed in a single commit THEN the agent SHALL analyze all changes and group related modifications together

### Requirement 2: Documentation Mapping

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to find all documentation that references changed code, so that every affected doc gets updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent detects a code change THEN the agent SHALL search documentation files for references to the changed code element
2. WHEN searching documentation THEN the agent SHALL support multiple documentation formats including Markdown, MDX, and plain text
3. WHEN a code element is referenced by name THEN the agent SHALL identify both exact matches and contextual references
4. IF documentation contains code examples THEN the agent SHALL detect when those examples use the changed API
5. WHEN multiple documentation files reference the same code element THEN the agent SHALL identify all affected files
6. IF no documentation references are found for a public API change THEN the agent SHALL flag this as missing documentation

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to generate accurate documentation updates that maintain the original tone and style, so that the docs feel human-written and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating documentation updates THEN the agent SHALL preserve the existing documentation structure and formatting
2. WHEN updating code examples THEN the agent SHALL modify only the changed portions while maintaining working, executable examples
3. WHEN describing API changes THEN the agent SHALL use clear, concise language that explains both what changed and why it matters
4. IF the original documentation includes additional context or warnings THEN the agent SHALL preserve this information unless it becomes invalid
5. WHEN updating function descriptions THEN the agent SHALL infer purpose from parameter names, types, and implementation context
6. IF a change introduces breaking changes THEN the agent SHALL add appropriate warnings or migration guidance to the documentation

### Requirement 4: Review and Approval Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review proposed documentation changes before they're committed, so that I can ensure accuracy and add human context where needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent generates documentation updates THEN the agent SHALL present changes in a diff format showing before and after
2. WHEN presenting changes THEN the agent SHALL provide a summary explaining what code changed and why the documentation update is needed
3. WHEN a user reviews changes THEN the agent SHALL support approve, reject, or edit actions
4. IF a user edits a proposed change THEN the agent SHALL learn from the modification to improve future suggestions
5. WHEN changes are approved THEN the agent SHALL apply updates to the documentation files
6. IF changes are rejected THEN the agent SHALL log the decision and not re-propose the same change for that code modification

### Requirement 5: Multi-Language and Framework Support

**User Story:** As a developer working in different languages and frameworks, I want the agent to understand various code syntaxes and documentation conventions, so that it works across my entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code THEN the agent SHALL support at minimum JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python
2. WHEN parsing code THEN the agent SHALL correctly identify language-specific constructs including classes, functions, types, interfaces, and decorators
3. WHEN generating documentation THEN the agent SHALL follow language-specific documentation conventions (JSDoc for JavaScript, docstrings for Python, etc.)
4. IF a project uses a specific documentation framework THEN the agent SHALL detect and follow that framework's conventions
5. WHEN encountering an unsupported language THEN the agent SHALL gracefully skip analysis and notify the user

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to configure which files and changes trigger documentation updates, so that the agent focuses on what matters for our project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the agent THEN users SHALL be able to specify which directories contain documentation
2. WHEN configuring the agent THEN users SHALL be able to define patterns for files to monitor and files to ignore
3. WHEN configuring the agent THEN users SHALL be able to set the minimum change severity that triggers updates (e.g., only public API changes)
4. IF a project has custom documentation conventions THEN users SHALL be able to provide style guidelines for the agent to follow
5. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the agent SHALL apply new settings to subsequent runs without requiring restart

### Requirement 7: Execution Modes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the agent both automatically on commits and manually on-demand, so that I have flexibility in my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with version control THEN the agent SHALL support running automatically on pre-commit, post-commit, or as a CI/CD step
2. WHEN running in automatic mode THEN the agent SHALL process only the files changed in the current commit
3. WHEN running in manual mode THEN users SHALL be able to specify which files or directories to analyze
4. IF running in CI/CD THEN the agent SHALL support creating pull requests with documentation updates
5. WHEN running locally THEN the agent SHALL support interactive mode where users can review and approve changes immediately
